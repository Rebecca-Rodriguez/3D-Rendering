# 3D-Rendering

For this project, I created, loaded, and rendered some basic 3D models. In addition, I created a simple orbit camera to help navigate a 3D scene.

**Key features**:
* Grid provides a frame of reference to help navigate 3D space
* Camera orbit functionality and required functions implemented
* Wireframe monster and half-scale monster loaded and drawn from .obj files
* Cubes as a PShape created and rendered 3 times with 3 transformations
* Triangle fans circle and hex with HSB color and stroke
